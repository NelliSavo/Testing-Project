## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
    It was really interested to do testing with the GitLab. I feel that with the actual project, I could easier to learn how testing could be done in real life and what things needs to be taken in to account in that. 
     
## 2. How did you write or manage your test case?
    I tried to write test cases as detailed and clear as possible
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management, 
      At the moment I don't have anyt other tools to recommend.   


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
     I have used Visual Studio Code.

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
    In some files I find it hard to write some variables mostly in that way that what variables are necessary. I also had sometimes feeling that did I wrote test case in write way or not. 

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
    I didn't had any problems to use GitHub because I have used it before in other courses with coding. 
       

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
    This would depends on various factors including what application being tested, the testing environment, budget and team's skills. 

    I would probably choose Selenium because it's widely used open-source automation testing tool and it supports multiple programming languages.

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 

    In my opinion the project helped me to put theoretical knowledge into practise. The theoretical parts were quite large entities to read and I myself would have liked some kind of tasks to accompany them. However, the latest project shows how in practise for example how to write bug report and test cases. 

    I personally, I liked the course, but perhaps I would have liked the course to be a little longer and to have more assignments on it.
